# Project Story
### Inspiration
People crave interaction and connection with other people. We spend most of our time on social media applications such as TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, essentially making it a key part of our lives. Many choose to showcase their life online, while some simply live life vicariously through those who share. Being popular on social media has also gained traction nowadays, and there is a good ROI for those who are able to reach these social media fame feats. We thought it'll be great to piggy-back on this concept and make volunteering a lot more attractive, accessible, and essentially beneficial.
 
### What it does
ConnectiVT is a social good media platform that allows you to connect with like-minded individuals, especially in the field of volunteering you are interested in. The application is built for everyone, with or without volunteering experience.

As an avid volunteer, you can create a profile and share your experiences on the application. Growing followers will be your goal here as you post more experiences and potentially get people more involved in the work you do. As a new volunteer, you can look for volunteer opportunities based on your interests, or the people you follow. Learning from their experiences is the best way to get started!

The four main features include:
**Home**
A social media feed page that showcases all the posts of the people you follow or are connected with.
**VO**
A page that allows the user to search for volunteer opportunities based on their initial interest. They can click on any opportunity to view more details and decide whether to help out or not. They can also choose to chat with the organization to gain more details.
**Veels**
A video sharing page that showcases quick videos of volunteer work happening around, and how one can be involved. 
**Profile**
A typical profile page that showcases one's volunteer experiences and interests.

### How we built it
We flutter for the application as we wanted it to be a mobile application (easily accessible).
We used firebase for the backend and to deploy the app.

### Challenges we ran into
Social media applications are quite prevalent, and there are many different apps already out there. We had to make sure we kept the experience focused on volunteering, and to encourage people to volunteer.

We did not have time to make a proper backend but worked with what we had. Having 2 people in the team wasn't that helpful either (we could have used the extra help).

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We achieved 75% of the goals we set out to achieve in this hackathon.

### What we learned
With limited time, make use of the existing resources and ideas out there and improve upon them to better suit your needs.
